Hey guys, welcome back to my blog. This semester I took a very interesting course ANTH 1300 People and Language. I learned so much about the study of languages and the way people use, interpret, and practice languages. One linguistic topic that I really wanted to focus on was the use of language in social media. Social media plays a major role in the way poeple in society engage in language. We use the internet to speak and express ourselves everyday, for example right now this blog post is just one way I use social media to practice language. As a result, billions upon billions of people are contantly using language in some way across the web every second. Thats how powerful this tool is in the study of languages. the amount of language there is to learn about through social media is infinite. Also, online, everyone has the complete freedom to use whatever language practices they choose without nearly as much fear and potential criticism from the local language traditions in their environment. Having a curtain of anonymity can be both a very positive and negative tool on social media. There sre msny identity issues that rise with this as will be discussed within this post.

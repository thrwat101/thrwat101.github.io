Some time ago, I worked on a small project where I implemented a doubly linked list. I thought it was a great way for me to really understand this data structure and its many applications in programming. For example, Linked lists are most commonly used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types. 

However, many challenges arise in the use of Linked lists, one of the most contrived problems is being able to **reverse** the list. And so, this is what I will be discussing in this post. To begin, let us redefine what a linked list is to refresh our memory.

**Linked List:** A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

In a ***singly*** linked list each node holds a value and a link to the next node.

In a ***doubly*** linked list each node also holds a link to the previous node.

Reversing a linked list is no simple task as it requires lots of pointer tracking but this is precisely the reason why learning this is so important, it really enforces the practice of variable/pointer manipulation. Data manipulation is an essential skill to have as a programmer and being able to manipulate many variables at the same time is crucial to solving complex problems.

Let us now take a look at how to solve this problem and reverse a singly linked list. The most common approach to this is to traverse the list and swap the nodes values such that the ***next*** will actually point to the ***head***, reversing the order. Here is some pseudocode to help us conceptualize this method.
~~~
function reverse(head)
  prev ← null
  while head.next is not null
    head.next ← prev
    prev ← head
    head ← old value of head.next
  head.next ← prev
  return head
  ~~~
By doing this, we are essentially enabling the last node to become the head and all nodes point to its preceeding node until we reach the tail, which is the first node. Such is seen in the following image of a given singly linked list:

Next lets discuss how we can reverse a doubly linked list.

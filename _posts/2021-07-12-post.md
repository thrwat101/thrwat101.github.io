Some time ago, I worked on a small project where I implemented a doubly linked list. I thought it was a great way for me to really understand this data structure and its many applications in programming. For example, Linked lists are most commonly used to implement stacks, queus, and other abstract data types. However, many challenges arise in the use of Linked lists, one of the most contrived problems is being able to **reverse** the list. And so, this is what I will be discussing in this post. 

To begin, let us redefine what a linked list is to refresh our memory.

**Linked List:** A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
{: .box-note}

In a **singly** linked list each node holds a value and a link to the next node.

In a **doubly** linked list each node also holds a link to the previous node.

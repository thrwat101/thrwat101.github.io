Hey there, 
If you are here you probably already know a little bit about me but allow me to properly introduce myself and my personal blog page. My name is Thrwat Najjar, I'm a senior at CUNY Brooklyn College as a computer science major with passions in security and systems. I want to work in an area that intersects my love for solving technically challenging problems and helping others.

Some personal hobbies that I really enjoy are reading books, trying new foods, and exploring new places.
